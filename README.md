# Study-and-Analysis-of-Breast-Cancer-Using-Genomics
Prediction of the breast cancer using microarray data
## Primary Steps Involved
1. Find the top ranking genes
2. Classifying the data with different classification algorithm and finding the one with best accuracy
## Data Required
The required data is in the "Data" Folder. Inside the "supervised_learning/data_used_for getting_output_data_set" there are two files 
which are processed using the code written in jupyter notebook inside the same folder. The output of combining and preprocessing 
of data is stored in the "supervised_learning/output_dataset" folder.
## Models
The classification models are written inside the Models folder in which concept of OOP and inheritance is abundantly used
## Task Completed Until Now
1. Combining the datasets and preprocessing the data
2. Making the classification models ready for the training.
